# ABSTRACT

Fill in abstract at the end after we have finished the methods, results,
discussion, conclusions and know what our data “says”.

# BACKGROUND

West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus that primarily
circulates between birds and mosquitoes. Birds are especially important
because many species develop high levels of virus in their blood,
allowing mosquitoes that feed on them to become infected and continue
the transmission cycle. By studying what animals mosquitoes have fed on,
we can better understand which hosts might play key roles in maintaining
and spreading WNV in an area.

In this project, we analyzed mosquito blood meals collected from sites
around Salt Lake City to identify which species mosquitoes were feeding
on. Each mosquito was placed in a small tube and homogenized to release
DNA from its blood meal. The DNA was then extracted and amplified using
PCR, and sequences were compared to reference databases to identify the
animal species the mosquito had recently fed upon.

These data allow us to link mosquito feeding patterns with WNV
surveillance results. Because some bird species, such as house finches,
can maintain detectable levels of viremia for several days (Kumar et
al., 2003), they may act as important amplifying hosts. Therefore, we
predict that locations where mosquitoes more frequently fed on house
finches will also show higher rates of WNV-positive mosquito pools.

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Questions

What bird species may be serving as the primary amplifying host for West
Nile virus (WNV) in Salt Lake City?

## Hypothesis

House finches play an important role as amplifying hosts for West Nile
virus (WNV) in Salt Lake City, contributing to higher transmission rates
in areas where they are more common.

## Prediction

If house finches serve as key amplifying hosts for WNV, then locations
where mosquitoes more frequently feed on house finches should show
higher numbers or rates of WNV-positive mosquito pools.

# METHODS

Mosquitoes were collected from several locations across Salt Lake City
using a variety of traps designed to capture blood-fed individuals. Each
mosquito was placed in a labeled tube for later analysis.

In the lab, we extracted DNA from the mosquitoes by homogenizing them in
lysis buffer to release the blood meal DNA. We then used PCR to amplify
vertebrate DNA from each sample, which allowed us to detect which animal
the mosquito had recently fed on.

The resulting PCR products were sequenced, and the sequences were
compared to reference databases using BLAST to identify the most likely
host species. These host identifications were then combined with
existing data on whether mosquitoes from the same locations tested
positive for West Nile virus (WNV).

Finally, we analyzed whether certain bird species, particularly house
finches, were associated with higher rates of WNV-positive mosquito
pools. Statistical tests and plots were created in R to explore and
visualize these relationships.

## Fill in first analysis

# put code for analysis here

Horizontal plots:

``` r
## import counts_matrix: data.frame with column 'loc_positives' (0/1) and host columns 'host_*'
counts_matrix <- read.csv("./bloodmeal_plusWNV_for_BIOL3070.csv")

## 1) Identify host columns
host_cols <- grep("^host_", names(counts_matrix), value = TRUE)

if (length(host_cols) == 0) {
  stop("No columns matching '^host_' were found in counts_matrix.")
}

## 2) Ensure loc_positives is present and has both levels 0 and 1 where possible
counts_matrix$loc_positives <- factor(counts_matrix$loc_positives, levels = c(0, 1))

## 3) Aggregate host counts by loc_positives
agg <- stats::aggregate(
  counts_matrix[, host_cols, drop = FALSE],
  by = list(loc_positives = counts_matrix$loc_positives),
  FUN = function(x) sum(as.numeric(x), na.rm = TRUE)
)

## make sure both rows exist; if one is missing, add a zero row
need_levels <- setdiff(levels(counts_matrix$loc_positives), as.character(agg$loc_positives))
if (length(need_levels)) {
  zero_row <- as.list(rep(0, length(host_cols)))
  names(zero_row) <- host_cols
  for (lv in need_levels) {
    agg <- rbind(agg, c(lv, zero_row))
  }
  ## restore proper type
  agg$loc_positives <- factor(agg$loc_positives, levels = c("0","1"))
  ## coerce numeric host cols (they may have become character after rbind)
  for (hc in host_cols) agg[[hc]] <- as.numeric(agg[[hc]])
  agg <- agg[order(agg$loc_positives), , drop = FALSE]
}

## 4) Decide species order (overall abundance, descending)
overall <- colSums(agg[, host_cols, drop = FALSE], na.rm = TRUE)
host_order <- names(sort(overall, decreasing = TRUE))
species_labels <- rev(sub("^host_", "", host_order))  # nicer labels

## 5) Build count vectors for each panel in the SAME order
counts0 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 0, host_order, drop = TRUE]))
counts1 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 1, host_order, drop = TRUE]))

## 6) Colors: reuse your existing 'cols' if it exists and is long enough; otherwise generate
if (exists("cols") && length(cols) >= length(host_order)) {
  species_colors <- setNames(cols[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
} else {
  species_colors <- setNames(rainbow(length(host_order) + 10)[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
}

## 7) Shared x-limit for comparability
xmax <- max(c(counts0, counts1), na.rm = TRUE)
xmax <- if (is.finite(xmax)) xmax else 1
xlim_use <- c(0, xmax * 1.08)

## 8) Plot: two horizontal barplots with identical order and colors
op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2),
          mar = c(4, 12, 3, 2),  # big left margin for species names
          xaxs = "i")           # a bit tighter axis padding

## Panel A: No WNV detected (loc_positives = 0)
barplot(height = counts0,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "(-)WNV Locations",
        xlim = xlim_use)

## Panel B: WNV detected (loc_positives = 1)
barplot(height = counts1,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "(+)WNV Locations",
        xlim = xlim_use)
```

Fill in here… Explain that you tested whether the presence or number of
house finch blood meals predicts whether a site had WNV-positive pools
(binary) or a higher WNV positivity rate (numeric). Mention that this
statistical test lets you formally evaluate the relationship suggested
by the barplots.

``` r
